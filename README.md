# Note Taker APP
The Note Taker App has been developed for the user to write and save notes to keep track of tasks and setting reminders for personal use. 

The Note Taker App has NPM packages installed and is using Express.js back end which will save and retrieve note data from the db.json file without saving or taking up memory from our local storage.
